Allows you to compress items within another pocket dimension within your pocket dimension using patent pending "Item Pocket Dimension Simulation Protocol For Compressing Items Within Digital Dimension" or IPDSPCIWDD for short. (We are still working on the name)

You are able to compress items in the workbench and also in the Assembler when unlocked.

Will add more on feedback.
