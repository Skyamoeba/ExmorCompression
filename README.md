Allows you to compress items within another pocket dimension within your pocket dimension using patent pending "Item Pocket Dimension Simulation Protocol For Compressing Items Within Digital Dimension" or IPDSPCIWDD for short. (We are still working on the name)

You are able to compress items in the workbench and also in the Assembler when unlocked.

Will add more on feedback.

[Internal Notes]

Key:
Space Elevator Parts = SEP

Swapped SEP 6 + 7 as they were numbered differently in game to what they are named on blueprints.

[Tier 9 Only] Added ExmorConverter (This may be the building that replaces all other machines used for compression testing in Tier 9)

Power Board is now created in the Converter so it can then be put into a Converter to make Alternate : Artificial Somersloop [Not Yet Added]
